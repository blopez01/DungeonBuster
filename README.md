===========================
Gameplay Overview:
Dungeon Buster is a first-person, future/fantasy, dungeon exploration game in which the player must acquire weapons and a boss key to access the boss door and defeat the dungeon boss to complete the game. Did I mention there's a boss? :)

How to Play:
- Open Dungeon Buster.exe
- Click begin at the title screen
- The player will spawn in the center of the dungeon, which they must explore to find weapons, buffs and the boss key to complete the game
- The current player objective is displayed at the top of the screen
- Move with WASD, look around with mouse, space to jump, F to pick up weapons/keys and open doors, left click to swing weapon
- There are 3 weapons available in the dungeon that the player will be able to find and equip
	- A katana with medium damage, knockback, and fire rate
	- A hammer with high damage and knockback, but low fire rate
	- A dagger with low damage and knockback, but high fire rate
- Your weapon arsenal is displayed at the bottom left of the screen, and your current weapon is displayed above your inventory
- There are 3 buffs available in the dungeon
	- A health replenish that will replenish 50 HP
	- A speed buff that doubles your speed
	- A jump buff that increases jump height
- Each buff is hidden in a jar, and will activate when the player walks into them. Buffs are permanent and a one-time use
- A key is hidden in one of the chests located somewhere in the dungeon, this is needed to access the boss room
- Once the boss key is collected, the player can enter the boss room and challenge the boss
- After all the enemies in the dungeon are defeated, the player can press F to climb the stairs in the boss room and complete the game
- If the player dies, the game will reset

About Dungeon Buster:
This was an early project for my Game Development class in spring 2020, and although it was an improvement on a previous project for the same class, its bugs and flaws definitely show. Originally, my plan was to create a randomly-generated dungeon exploration game that was different every time you loaded the game using pre-built prefab rooms. However, due to time constraints and inexperience, that feature was scrapped and I had to settle for something a little more static to keep it functional. Other noticable bugs are the camera clipping issue with the character's head, doors not opening upon first F press, knockback issues with the hammer. These are all things that I would improve upon if I ever revisited this project in the future, but serve as a stepping stone in my growth as a game developer for now :)
